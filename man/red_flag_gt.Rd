\title{GT Table: Red Flags for Verification}
\format{
A `gt_tbl` object with 2 columns:
\describe{
  \item{Category}{Thematic category of the red flag. Displayed once per group.}
  \item{Red Flag}{Description of the issue or anomaly encountered during monitoring.}
}
}
\source{
TPM HER Facility Monitoring Verification Framework, Afghanistan, 2025.
}
\usage{
red_flag_gt
}
\description{
A pre-formatted `gt` table object displaying red flags encountered during health facility monitoring and verification
exercises. The table organizes red flags into thematic categories such as Human Resources, Infrastructure,
Protection & Ethics, and more.
}
\details{
This table is intended for inclusion in analytical reports, dashboards, and stakeholder presentations as a
clear and readable summary of key verification concerns.


The `gt` table groups red flags by category using a non-repeating `Category` column (`Display_Category` in the raw data)
and applies bold styling to improve legibility. Each category group is separated by a soft top border for visual clarity.
Padding is adjusted using the custom `gtayblr::adjust_row_padding()` function to condense row height for compact display.

This object is generated from the `red_flags_verif` dataset, which contains a full list of predefined verification red flags
used in the Health Emergency Response (HER) project in Afghanistan.
