\format{
A `gt_tbl` object with 4 rows and 5 columns.

}
\description{
A styled `gt` table object that presents a summary of the facility-level scoring methodology
used in the Quantified Quality Metrics (QQM) system for third-party monitoring of health services.
}
\details{
This table includes:
- Domain definitions (Structural, Content of Care, Quality of Care)
- Maximum possible scores
- Scoring formulas
- Example calculations
- Weighted composite formula for the overall QQM score

The table is formatted with `gt()` and styled with fixed column widths, bolding of the final
row, soft borders between rows, and an explanatory source note.


This object is built from the `qqm_calc` dataset and intended for direct use in R Markdown or Quarto documents,
dashboards, or rendered reports. It includes custom styling via `si_gt_base()` and consistent alignment and spacing
for professional presentation.

The final row ("Overall QQM Score") is bolded to emphasize the composite nature of the scoring system:
\deqn{Score = (0.4 × Structural) + (0.4 × Content) + (0.2 × Quality)}
}
