\title{Recode Likert-scale responses into a new column}
\usage{
recode_likert(
  data,
  column,
  .to = NULL,
  scale = c(`1` = "strong.*disagree", `2` = "^disagree$", `3` = "^agree$", `4` =
    "strong.*agree"),
  labels = c(`1` = "Strongly disagree", `2` = "Disagree", `3` = "Agree", `4` =
    "Strongly agree")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{column}{A column in `data` to recode (unquoted).}

\item{.to}{Optional name for the new column. Defaults to `<column>_recode`.}

\item{scale}{A named character vector where names are numeric values (as strings)
and values are regex patterns used to match Likert-style text (e.g., `"strong.*agree"`).}

\item{labels}{A named character vector mapping numeric codes (as strings)
to their Likert-style text labels, used when converting from numeric to text.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the recoded column added.
}
\description{
Recodes a column of Likert-style responses either from text to numeric or
from numeric to text, depending on its current type. A new column is created
with the recoded values.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(dplyr)

df <- tibble(response = c("Agree", "Disagree", "Strongly agree"))
df |> recode_likert(response)

df2 <- tibble(response = c(3, 1, 4))
df2 |> recode_likert(response)
}
}
