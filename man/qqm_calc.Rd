\title{Summary Table of QQM Scoring Process at Facility Level}
\format{
A data frame with 4 rows and 5 columns:
\describe{
  \item{Domain}{Name of the QQM scoring domain (e.g., Structural Indicators, Content of Care)}
  \item{Max Points}{Maximum number of points assigned to the domain. Varies by facility type for structural indicators}
  \item{Description}{Narrative description of how the domain is assessed}
  \item{Scoring Method}{Formula used to compute the domain-level percentage score}
  \item{Example Score}{Illustrative example based on a sample facility's results}

\description{
This dataset summarizes the scoring methodology for the Quantified Quality Metrics (QQM) used in third-party monitoring
of health facility performance. The table outlines the key domains assessed (Structural Indicators, Content of Care,
Quality of Care), maximum points per domain, scoring methods, and example scores from a sample facility. It also
includes the weighted formula used to calculate the overall QQM score.
}
\details{
The overall QQM score is a weighted combination of three domain scores:
- 40% Structural Indicators
- 40% Content of Care
- 20% Quality of Care

The dataset supports the generation of a formatted `gt` table for inclusion in reporting outputs.
