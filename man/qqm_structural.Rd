\title{Structural Quality Domains in the QQM Process}
\format{
A data frame with 10 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{row}{Integer. Row number or sequential order of domains.}
  \item{domain}{Character. The structural quality domain assessed (e.g., Hygiene, OPD, Maternity).}
  \item{points}{Integer. Maximum points available for the domain within the QQM structural score.}
  \item{total_points}{Integer. Total max points avaiable across all structural domains for non BHCs facilities.}
  \item{total_points_bhc}{Integer. Total max points available across all structural domains for BHCs facilities.}
  \item{domain_label}{Character. A full label of each domain with Domain number pre-pended.}
}

\usage{

}
\description{
A dataset listing the structural quality domains assessed under the Quantified Quality Metrics (QQM) process, along with the maximum points allocated to each domain. These domains are part of the facility-level structural assessment used in calculating composite quality scores for the Health Emergency Response (HER) project.
}
\details{
The structural domains cover a wide range of facility readiness and service delivery areas, including infection prevention, drug management, and reproductive health services. Each domain contributes to the overall facility quality score used in the performance-based payment mechanism.
