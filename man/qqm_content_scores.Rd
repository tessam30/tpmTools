\title{Content of Care Vignette Domains and Maximum Scores}
\format{
A tibble with 10 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
  \item{Content of Care Domain}{Numbered label and short title of the vignette domain as it appears in training and data tools.}
  \item{Domain Name}{Full descriptive title used in reports and dashboards to describe each vignette domain.}
  \item{Max Score}{Maximum points achievable for the vignette. Most domains are scored out of 100; some may exceed 100, indicated as "100+".}

\description{
A dataset describing the clinical vignette domains included in the Content of Care component of the Quantified Quality Metric (QQM) scoring system.
Each vignette is designed to assess the knowledge and clinical decision-making of health workers in specific maternal, newborn, child health, and
family planning scenarios.
}
\details{
These content domains are assessed via case-based vignettes administered to health workers. Each vignette is scored against a checklist
reflecting essential steps and quality of care standards. Scores from all vignettes contribute equally to the overall Content of Care score
(40% weight in the final QQM composite).

The domains include both curative child health conditions (e.g., pneumonia, diarrhea), preventive services (e.g., growth monitoring),
maternal care (e.g., labor, postnatal care, postpartum hemorrhage), and family planning counseling.
